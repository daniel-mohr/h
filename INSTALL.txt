INSTALL: pfu
++++++++++++

info
====

before you install
==================

Modules
-------

pfu needs the following python modules (most of them are standard and
already in your python installation from a package management)

 * argparse
 * base64
 * hashlib
 * logging
 * logging.handlers
 * os
 * os.path
 * pickle
 * signal
 * sys
 * threading
 * time

and the own modules which comes with this package.

You can also asked the installation routine/script for the python modules::

  python setup.py --help
  python setup.py --requires

There is also a small extra command to check for availability of
necessary python modules::

  python setup.py check_modules

If you want to use this complete software you should have no modules
which are not available.

Much more information you get from the following small extra command
by using the modulefinder::

  python setup.py check_modules_modulefinder

It is normal that there are many missing modules reported. Please look
at the details.
